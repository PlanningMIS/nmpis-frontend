                                <p class="mb-4">
                                  The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) of Tanzania plays a central role in managing and supporting the nation’s teaching workforce. However, the commission is currently constrained by inadequate infrastructure, especially at the district level. Most existing offices lack the capacity to accommodate staff comfortably, hindering the effective provision of services to teachers.
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-4">
                                  To address these challenges, the government proposes a landmark project: the construction of <strong>114 modern district offices</strong> for the Teachers Service Commission. These new offices will provide a conducive environment for staff to operate efficiently, improve service delivery mechanisms, enhance the management of employment records, and foster institutional growth and professionalism within TSC.
                                </p>
